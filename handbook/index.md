# Methods Overview

Some stuff here about the structure of the handbook.

In general, Dav likes the philosophy behind the [Hitchhiker's Guide to
Python](): ideally offer a single reasonable approach that someone can get
started with.  Document alternative approaches briefly as absolutely necessary.

Good models are UCLA and Wisconsin (write a blog post on this).

## Methods Proper

Coordinate with Nora, grab skeleton from Methods.

## Technical Stuff

### Collaboration, esp. Open (Source)

The simplest thing (for Berkeley) is to use wix.com for websites, and
lists.berkeley.edu as the mailing list.

[Most people do not have their emails specifically disabled for Google Groups -
that's probably the best for most people.]
