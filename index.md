## Mailing list

The mailing list will be low traffic (about one message a week), please
subscribe so we can keep you informed of changes, and when papers become
available!

Sign up
[here](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/dlab-methods@lists.berkeley.edu).
Note that if you use your berkeley.edu address, you'll be able to manage your
subscription with your CalNet login.

## Zotero

Papers are available in [our zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/social_science_methods). If you don't already have it, click the big red button on [the Zotero
site](https://www.zotero.org).

Once you sign up for our group, whenever you open Zotero (within Firefox, or as
a standalone app), it will automatically sync our papers, and you can get the
papers for the next meeting in the *For Next Meeting* folder. I'm tagging them
with *required* if they are required and *recommended* otherwise (you can filter
easily by tag in Zotero). Feel free to stick potential papers for discussion in
*Potential*.

If, however, you struggle with Zotero, you should join our mailing list! We send
direct links there as well.

## About this Website

I (Dav) will be updating this site aggressively. I welcome your help in keeping
the group resources up-to-date! If you're uncomfortable with GitHub, please ask
me to use the very user-friendly prose.io! The GitHub link for this site is at
the bottom of every page!
