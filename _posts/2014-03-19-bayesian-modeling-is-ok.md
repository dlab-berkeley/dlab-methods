title: Bayesian Modeling is OK
author: Dav Clark
---
This week, we shift to the relatively *un*controversial practice of Bayesian
modeling. You can even do frequentist statistics on your results.

### Papers

For an overview, we'll read:

> Perfors, A., Tenenbaum, J. B., Griffiths, T. L., & Xu, F. (2011). A tutorial introduction to Bayesian models of cognitive development. Cognition, 120(3), 302–321.

And for application, we'll read:

> Tenenbaum, J. B., Griffiths, T. L., & Kemp, C. (2006). Theory-based Bayesian models of inductive learning and reasoning. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 10(7), 309–318. doi:10.1016/j.tics.2006.05.009

It's all a little cognitively focused, but hopefully we can see how this might
be applied to learning in societies, institutions, etc.!
