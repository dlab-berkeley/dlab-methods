### What's in a model?

This week we will focus on theoretical models. There are two required readings:

1. Chapter 1 of A Model Disipline by Clarke and Primo

2. The Fall and Rise of Development Economics by Krugman (focus on  "The Evolution of Ignorance" and "Metaphors and Models" sections)

All readings are uploaded in Zotero.

Chapters 3 and 6 of A Model Discipline are also included, but are not required reading.

### Take homes

Models are useful. It's good to think about them!
