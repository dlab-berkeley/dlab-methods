### Some psychologists argue *strongly* for bayesian stats

Only last week, we heard scathing (and well-argued) remarks against the use of
Bayesian methods for scientific hypothesis testing. Yet, some very smart people
argue in precisely the opposite direction...

Despite the appeal of Dienes' preferred method of model choice, given it's
analogous structure to Neyman-Pearson Null Hypothesis Significance Testing
(NHST), the results appear to vary quite readily given your choice of prior. Of
course, Deines -- and some other Bayesians -- think this is a strength.

However, it just feels safer to use Kruschke's preferred method of the
construction of "credible intervals" -- much more analogous to frequentist
confidence intervals. Of course, maybe confidence intervals are superior to NHST
in the frequentist world as well...
