### Event Studies

This week, Glenda led us through a pair of papers about event studies:

> Jacobson, L. S., LaLonde, R. J., & Sullivan, D. G. (1993). Earnings Losses of
> Displaced Workers. The American Economic Review, 83(4), 685–709.

> MacKinlay, A. C. (1997). Event Studies in Economics and Finance. Journal of
> Economic Literature, 35(1), 13–39.

Here are [Glenda's Slides]({{ BASE_PATH }}/materials/eventstudy.pdf).

We didn't quite get to the Earnings loss paper. But I recommend it as a more
interesting application of the methods!

Coming up next week, we'll start a back-to-back comparison of statistical
worldviews, starting with the Bayesian perspective.
