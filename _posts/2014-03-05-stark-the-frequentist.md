### What is the difference?

Ryan made a nice chart, which we have a picture of and we'll put up soon. More
generally, it seems that similar concerns arise again: how can we be thoughtful
and conscientious about our science? Neither Bayes nor Fisher & Neyman provide
an easy out.

Next week we'll talk about arguments for Bayes.

Some issues that we're thinking about down the road:

 - “Theory” (as Ryan defines it)
 - Non-parametric approaches
 - Example of two bayesians choosing different priors yeilding different
   conclusions (follow Stark reference)
 - Slomanoff induction
 - Proper philosophy of science (e.g., Popper, Kuhn, etc.)
