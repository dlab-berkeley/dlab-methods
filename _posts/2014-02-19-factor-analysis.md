### Topics from Paper

For this, week, please try to read through all of the Fabrigar paper on
Exploratory Factor Analysis. It's technical, but even if you don't follow the
detail, it raises what I consider to be a fairly complete set of high-level
issues - which is what we'll focus on this week:

 - Latent Variables
 - Exploratory vs. Confirmatory techniques
 - Descriptive / Data Mining techniques vs. Model Theoretic techniques
 - Dealing with ordinal scales (e.g., Likert scales; discussed in supplemental materials)

Here's what we read:

> Fabrigar, L. R., Wegener, D. T., MacCallum, R. C., & Strahan, E. J. (1999).
> Evaluating the use of exploratory factor analysis in psychological research.
> Psychological Methods, 4(3), 272.

> Flora, D. B., & Curran, P. J. (2004). An Empirical Evaluation of Alternative
> Methods of Estimation for Confirmatory Factor Analysis With Ordinal Data.
> Psychological Methods, 9(4), 466â€“491. doi:10.1037/1082-989X.9.4.466

For background, I've included a handout from Wicken's psych stats class, as well
as a fairly technical overview of Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Flora and
Curran. Both of these are supplemental. The latter discusses methods for ordinal
scales like Likert items, which aren't covered in the Fabrigar paper.  Examples:

 - Movement patterns
 - Survey data
 - Voting / adjudicating behavior (a la Ryan's research)
 - Physiologic / health data

### Business

Jess can come after Feb 26 (week after next) - plan on Bayesian / Frequentist
stats meetings after that?

Anything else?
