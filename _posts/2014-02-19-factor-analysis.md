### Business

Jess can come after Feb 26 (week after next) - plan on Bayesian / Frequentist
stats meetings after that?

Anything else?

### Topics from Paper

For this, week, please try to read through all of the Fabrigar paper on
Exploratory Factor Analysis. It's technical, but even if you don't follow the
detail, it raises what I consider to be a fairly complete set of high-level
issues - which is what we'll focus on this week:

 - Latent Variables
 - Exploratory vs. Confirmatory techniques
 - Descriptive / Data Mining techniques vs. Model Theoretic techniques
 - Dealing with ordinal scales (e.g., Likert scales; discussed in supplemental materials)

For background, I've included a handout from Wicken's psych stats class, as well
as a fairly technical overview of Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Flora and
Curran. Both of these are supplemental. The latter discusses methods for ordinal
scales like Likert items, which aren't covered in the Fabrigar paper.  Examples:

 - Movement patterns
 - Survey data
 - Voting / adjudicating behavior (a la Ryan's research)
 - Physiologic / health data
