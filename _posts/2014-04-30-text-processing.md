### Laura Nelson's research on text

Laura's been a great expositor of text analysis methods here in the D-Lab (and
beyond). This week, we'll look at a pair of papers by Grimmer and colleagues:

Required:
> Grimmer, J., & Stewart, B. M. (2013). Text as Data: The Promise and Pitfalls
> of Automatic Content Analysis Methods for Political Texts. Political Analysis,
> 21(3), 267–297. doi:10.1093/pan/mps028

Supplemental:
> Grimmer, Justin, & King, G. (2011).
> General purpose computer-assisted clustering and conceptualization.
> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108(7), 2643–2650.
> doi:10.1073/pnas.1018067108

The future isn't entirely clear. We may have at least one more meeting over the
summer where Leora gives us a brief intro to survey methods. I (Dav) would like
to shift gears towards organizing the material we've covered into a bit more of
a curriculum. But in any case come prepared to think about the summer!
