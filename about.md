## Mailing list

The mailing list will be low traffic (about one message a week), please
subscribe so we can keep you informed of changes, and when papers become
available!

Sign up
[here](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/dlab-methods@lists.berkeley.edu).
Note that if you use your berkeley.edu address, you'll be able to manage your
subscription with your CalNet login.

## Zotero

Papers are available in [our zotero
group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/social_science_methods). If you don't
already have it, click the big red button on [the Zotero
site](https://www.zotero.org).

Once you sign up for our group, whenever you open Zotero (within Firefox, or as
a standalone app), it will automatically sync our papers, and you can get the
papers for the next meeting in the *For Next Meeting* folder. Papers we'll
discuss are tagged *required* or *recommended*. Background material is tagged
*supplemental* (you can filter easily by tag in Zotero). Feel free to stick
potential papers for discussion in *Potential*.

If you struggle with Zotero, you should join our mailing list! We'll send
direct links there as well.

## About this Website

I (Dav) will be updating this site aggressively. I welcome your help in keeping
the group resources up-to-date. If you're uncomfortable with GitHub, please ask
me to use the very user-friendly prose.io! The GitHub link for this site is at
the bottom of every page.
